# odin-recipes
This project is a basic recipe website, will which will utlize all the HTML skills I have learned so far in The Odin Project.  
The skills I will be demonstrating for this project will include:  
- Link generation
- Image generation
- Page(s) generation

Reflections and what I've learned:
- Learned how to impliment '< br >' in text to prevent it from going past the end of the image
- Decided to put the original link to each recipe on the bottom of each recipe page, and had it open in a new tab
- When making my links on the index page, used < p > to help separate each line, then realized I could use < ul > to help list them out instead, making it easier to add more if needed.

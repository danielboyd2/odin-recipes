        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking pan with cooking spray.<br>
                Place chicken on the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, flipping chicken after 12 minutes.<br>
                Remove from the oven, add desired amount of sauce, and top each breast with mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear,<br>
                about 12 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
